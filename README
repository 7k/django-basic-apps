Inlines is a template filter that can be used in
conjunction with inline markup to insert content objects
into other pieces of content. An example would be inserting
a photo into a blog post body. 

An example of the markup is:
  <inline type="media.photo" id="1" />

The type attribute is app_name.model_name and the id is
the object id. Pretty simple. 

In your template you would say:
  {% load inlines %}
  
  {{ post.body|render_inlines }}
